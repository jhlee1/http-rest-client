# http-rest-client

## This is a custom http client using rest template from Spring 4.3
- If you are using different spring version, it might make version conflicts. 
  - You are free to change the spring version. It will work on 4.3 <.
- From Spring 5.x, they recommend to use [WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html)
- I have created it to use in a project which is using Spring 4.x
